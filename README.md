## JavaScript exercise

**Goal**: Production of a client-side Web application to help a child understand multiplication.

**Description**: The application will display a grid of all the numbers from 1 to 144 evenly laid out with a large clickable box around each number. The number should be centered in each box. When the child clicks a box then all the numbers which are a multiple of that number should be highlighted in some way. Clicking on a second number removes the highlighting of the previous selection, then highlights the multiples of the newly selected number.

**Constraints**: On mobile devices the grid will display 1 number per row. On tablet devices 2 numbers per row and on desktop and larger devices 3 numbers per row. The numbers should fill their rows equally. When the screen width grows very large a margin should appear either side of the grid so that the boxes donâ€™t keep getting larger.
